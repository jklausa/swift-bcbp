# swift-bcbp

A Swift-y printer-parser for BCBP (Bar Coded Boarding Pass) format.

                                Most other packages usually only support _parsing_ the format, this one explicitly also supports _creating_ the BCBP data.

## Status

                                Based on my personal (300+) collection of boarding passes, which should be plenty of test data; in addition to the reference of the BCBP implementation guide.
